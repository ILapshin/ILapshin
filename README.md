I'm a Project Engineer in [POINT, JSC](https://www.pointcad.ru/), leading projects for CAD/PDM add-ons developement. Our awesome products can generate 3D models of comlex engineering system in a couple of minutes (instead of days designing it manually) and generate 2D documentation after that also in minutes. 

I'm much interested in blockchain technologies for it is the future stands for it, so I spend spare time for learning how it works and how to develop stuff for an approaching Web 3.0.

I also have large mechanical engineering background so I know how iron works and not afraid to screw a couple of nuts with my own hands.

<h3> Please, feel free to check out my repos for learning blockchain projects!</h3> (And also old ML stuff I was messing with some time ago.)
